The second step, negotiation, allows you to spend less time on unimportant tasks. The third way is to delegate sometimes, and the fourth is improving systems and processes so that repetitive tasks are quickly and easily managed. Last but not least, Chris explains how to overcome perfectionism and nitpicking. He explains how to apply the five methods to all time-stealers, including meetings, interruptions, and more.

> In the initial chapters, he'll help you clarify your life and work goals, prioritize to-dos using Eisenhower's matrix of tasks, and answers questions like "Does working longer hours actually get more done?" The worksheets included with the exercise files will help you apply the lessons to your own work and life, and hone your time management skills—one step at a time.

## 1. The Importance of Time Management
### The objective of time management
- Time management: Maximize time spent on important things
- Less time for unimportant things, and more time for important things
- I would hope that there is some correlation between you think is important and what your boss or your company think is important
- You can get away with neglecting important things - for a short time
- However, if you neglect important things, they will catch up to you.
- You'll pay the price of regret later.
- Goals should combine **enjoyment and achievement**

### The important of clear goals
- If an activity moves you towards your goals, it's important, and if it doesn't, then it's not important. It's as simple as that.
- Enjoy and achieve, both at home and at work
- Goals
    + Written down: far more likely to happen 
    + Specific: to be more clear
    + Positive: 
- Why do Goals Work?
    + They set your subconscious in the right direction: Without an internal SatNav, you'll drift through life, and end up somewhere that you probably don't want to be.
    + They increase self-discipline and assertiveness.

### Why you must make the most of every day
- How many weekends is left for you: 52 weeks per year
- Urgency and pressure leads to the important stuff being neglected. And then eventually, when it's too late, you pay the price of regret.

## 2. Prioritizing

### What prioritizing really means
- Prior: how important they are 
- Important but probably not urgent: for example your children

### How to separate important from urgent

### Eisenhower's matrix of tasks
- "I have two kinds of problems, the urgent and the important. The urgent are not important, and the important are never urgent" -- Dwight D. Eisenhower
- Box format
    1. Crisis(Do First): Do it now and do it properly
    2. Hassle(Delegate): Spend minimum time on it
    3. Progress(Schedule): Plan (and do) ahead
    4. (Un)Necessary Evils(Don't Do): If it will get worse, delegate it or don't do it

### Box 3 of Eisenhower's matrix

### Is there more to life than planning?
- Box 3 planing time can help you enjoy and achieve. It's not just about work and results.
- Fun *is* important, and can fit into time management.

### Is working longer hour a good idea?
-  Longer hours provide a safety net that can decrease self-discipline.
-  It would be quite disloyal to say "Nope, I always go home at five and I'm not gonna help with a company crisis, see you tomorrow, guys."

### How to get more time for important things
- Spend as much as time in box 3, and reduce the time spend in the other three boxes, mainly box 2 (hassle)
- Do three little jobs
    + box three awareness. Write down what percentage you think you spend on average on four boxes, and tomorrow, see how much time you actually get for box 3.
    + Start a log of when you leave work.
    + Stop taking work home.

## 3. The 5 Ways to Control Your Time

### Option 1: Say no at work
