> Today's word is disparagingly, which is an adverb as you can guess. The adjective form is 'disparaging' and the verb form is 'disparage', which is spelled 'DISPARAGE'. 
>
> A disparaging word or term is the word you use to criticize something, or to express that something is of little worth. It can also be addressed as 'a derogatory term' 贬义词
> 
> Disparage has two meanings: 1) to describe things as unimportant or bad : to belittle, to depreciate. e.g. He never missed an opportunity to disparage his competitors" 2) to make things unimportant/ to lower the reputation: Your behavior will disparage the whole family.

> 
> This word appears in the beginning of Chapter 5: She said this not disparagingly, but affectionately rather, as though, by acknowledging the worst about him, she wished to protect him from the aspersions of her friends.她用这个词一点儿也没有贬抑的意思，相反地，倒是怀着一股深情，好像由她自己说出他最大的缺点就可以保护他不受她朋友们的挖苦似的。 (Chapter 5)
